# FrontEnd_digitalAgency
http://agenciadigital.marinho.tech/  
Website of a digital agency, used as a template within a portfolio. Created using the WordPress framework and migrated to html as a static page.
Using Astra free I made this site on top of a template. Its purpose is just to illustrate the things you can do using WordPress.
After finishing I used the plugin "Simply Static" to migrate it to HTML, but the direct migration comes with small defects. 
I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS and PHP to fix these small errors and make the site work on any hosting again.
